						<summary><h3>a bit about me:</h3></summary>
						<ul>
							<li>
								i used to have an unhealthy obsession with spending waay too much
								time competing in
								<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/bkkaggle">kaggle</a>
								competitions for a couple of years.
							</li>
							<li>
								i did a lot of full-stack dev work, mostly with react/react native
								and node, but i'm a little out of touch with whatever js frameworks
								are cool nowadays.
							</li>
							<li>
								i <a href="https://github.com/bkkaggle/L2">wrote</a> a machine
								learning library in rust, which was a really fun language to work
								with—it's hard to beat the feeling of rewriting a few thousand lines
								of code and having them compile+pass all the test cases on the first
								try.
							</li>
							<li>
								i started going for a 5k run every morning during quarantine
								(keeping this up during school is still a wip).
							</li>
							<li>
								i once wrote what was essentially a very sus but also impressively
								feature-rich server-side rendering web framework in plain php by
								concatenating together *very* long strings of html based on data
								pulled from a db.
							</li>
							<li>
								^ was waay back before 12yo me even knew that things like github,
								react, or js frameworks existed, i was pretty clueless back then.
							</li>
							<li>
								i can speak 4 languages (english, urdu, french, and japanese) in
								diminishing levels of proficiency.
							</li>
							<li>
								i've visited several countries on 4 continents so far (covid has put
								a freeze on those plans for now).
							</li>
							<li>i skipped highschool and never got a diploma.</li>
